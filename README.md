# terminal-tac-toe
A simple tic-tac-toe game written in Python.

This was mostly an exercise in putting together different functions and elementary logic. 

I plan on adding different functionality like being able to input player names and have those displayed along with their corresponding symbol. 
I also will be adding a basic bot to play against in the absence of a second player.

Until then, I'm open to feedback, criticism, etc.
